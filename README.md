# Phish Kit Collection

## Introduction

This is the code used in our experiment to collect phishing kits at scale. This requires integrations with phishing feed providers, which may need API keys or other credentials.

## Deploying to EC2

We ran our experiment using an Amazon EC2 instance. This are the basic commands to get up and running.

### Install the ELK Stack

First, you need to install Elasticsearch and Kibana
```
# Remove Java 1.7 in favor of Java 1.8
sudo yum install java-1.8.0
sudo yum remove java-1.7.0-openjdk

# Then, install Elasticsearch
sudo rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch

echo '[elasticsearch-5.x]
name=Elasticsearch repository for 5.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo > /dev/null

sudo yum install elasticsearch
sudo chkconfig --add elasticsearch

# Start Elasticsearch
sudo -i service elasticsearch start


# Install Kibana
echo '[kibana-5.x]
name=Kibana repository for 5.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kibana.repo > /dev/null

sudo yum install kibana
sudo chkconfig --add kibana

# Start Kibana
sudo -i service kibana start
```

### Download the Code

To get the `phish_collect` code, clone the repository from Github:

```
git clone https://github.com/duo-labs/phish_collect.git
cd phish_collect
```

### Create our Indexes

To index values in Elasticsearch, we have to create our indexes. We can do that with this command:

```
curl -XPUT localhost:9200/samples -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @es_index.json
```

### Install Python Requirements

Next, you need to install all the requirements:

```
virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Make run script executable

```
chmod +x run.sh
```

### Setup the Crontab

Since we want to run the script every 10 minutes, we need to add the following to our crontab:

```
*/10 * * * * cd phish_collect && ./run.sh
```

That's all there is to it! Now new samples will be downloaded and indexed to Kibana.
